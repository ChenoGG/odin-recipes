        <h2>Eat big to get big, says Odin. Wait, this is ice cream though..</h2>
        <p>This homemade ice cream is easy to make with just 4 simple ingredients!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir milk, cream, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved.
                 Heat just until the mixture is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge.</li>
            <li>Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup.
                 Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours.
                  (Overnight is best.)</li>
            <li>Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine,
                 and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately
                 or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream
                  and place in the freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        </ol>
